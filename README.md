## Credits


I used these third-party resources to research the correct code tags and elements I needed:

- I referenced [W3Docs](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-mailto-links.html) for how to create an email link
- My friend Elyssa Winch helped me format the border and margin properties to 0 in the header and h1 tags. She also helped me created div classes for the images.
