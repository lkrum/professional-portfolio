## Credits

I used these resources to research the correct code tags and elements I needed:

- I referenced [W3Docs](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-mailto-links.html) for how to create an email link
- I referenced https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_text.asp#gsc.tab=0 for how to place text over an image
- I referenced the section 2 mini project for how to do a hover transition ./assets/css/style.css
- My friend Elyssa Winch helped me format the border and margin properties to 0 in the header and h1 tags. She also helped me created div classes for the portfolio images.
